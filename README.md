# About
This mod removes various annoyances found in owo-lib such as [advertisements in logs](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib/blob/1.20/src/main/java/io/wispforest/owo/util/Wisdom.java#L22) and [messing with REI UIs when "froge" is written](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib/blob/1.20/src/main/java/io/wispforest/owo/compat/rei/OwoReiPlugin.java#L139).

## Log adverts
This should no longer show up in your minecraft logs.

## REI "easter egg" animation
Now, if you enter `froge` into the REI searchbar, this animation no longer happens and your logs are no longer spammed with
```
[23:44:21] [Render thread/INFO]: OpenGL debug message: id=1000, source=API, type=ERROR, severity=HIGH, message='glScissor has generated an error (GL_INVALID_VALUE)'
```
